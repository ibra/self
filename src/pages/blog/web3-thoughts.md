There has been a lot of hype surrounding the whole Web3 space as of late, whether that be from the metaverse, NFT's or cryptocurrency. 
##
Web3 seems to suggest that it is trying to bring the internet back to its decentralized roots, and while yeah decentralization is nice, there is no material technological advancement or really frankly any benefit at all that has quantifiably been had. 
##
NFT's are being integrated into products that least require them, and the only real reason this is all transpiring is to benefit the people at the top; reeling in more investors drawn by these wishful-at-best buzzwords.
##
*Still something to be fair about though however, is to not shut your mind off to any future technological advancements that may be made in the whole decentralization space. Its important to realize the current applications of a certain technology are not the only applications that will be made in the future and that it is not at all hypocritical to reject applications while being open to ideas. Whether those advancements will actually come is a different matter altogether :P*
##
There is nothing new or innovative that the blockchain is offering as of now. There is no "problem" to be solved by the magical blockchain, on the contrary it is fundamentally impossible for the concept to work at a large scale for mature applications specifically. There is no escaping the problems that arise when you want to make something like a fully decentralized chat app, or social media app or literally anything at all that involves requiring human interaction, frequent iteration or moderation of said hypothetical platform etc. 
##
It is a concept fundamentally falling apart at this stage of scrutiny and, it's preposterous to even bring up the idea that the blockchain will somehow "solve the problems with centralization" when it can't even stand on its own feet without it.  
##
So let's take for example NFT's. Well the thing that supposedly makes them so great is how they provide "decentralized, true, asset ownership". However, what makes their current usage completely fall apart, and something you may or may not have noticed was that Non-Fungible Tokens dont actually store the data on the blockchain itself like many NFT shills seem to naively believe.
##
When you own a Non-Fungible Token, what you own in actuality is merely a link to a url that points to a **very centralized** server that is fully under the control of the NFT provider (Opensea, Rarible, whatever's your poison). So basically what that means for NFT's is that if OpenSea or Rarible ever just feel like it, they can just remove your NFT and that does not just unlist it but straight up directly removes it from your wallet. 
##
The entire point of web3 it seemed like, was to run from these big massive centralized servers and not be under their authority. Well looks it is forming the very same centralized systems it was allegedly supposed to replace. Who would have thought!!!!!

## Postamble
It’s plausible that I am completely wrong and web3 truly is the next big thing as the crypto and nft shills say it is. Being wrong about something like this is definitely something that I wouldn't be immensely shocked to have been. Theres very definitely strides being made in this space, and I truly do hope that web3 ushers in this utopia of decentralization and financial deregulation that it has hyped up to no end. But until then I hope the 14 year olds pumping memecoin ponzi schemes from their mothers basement are happy.
