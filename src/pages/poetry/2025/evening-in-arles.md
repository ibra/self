I've never met a hill I wouldn't die on. You  
were several marked by paths you now deprive  
me of and sparsely dotted next to riverbeds  
<br>
the pelicans  
can no longer drink near.  
<br>
We pass the Rh√¥ne and imagine starless nights  
unpainted. The uninteresting forever unaccounted  
for by a canvas they refused to etch across.  
<br>
I miss  
the one I beg to form the Pleiades.  
She too fades away with the night.  
<br>
Lonely boats row in pairs. I flicker as  
the observant streetlamp passed under.  
<br>
Your quick reprieve on the waves. My  
photons brushing against tender skin.  
<br>
The fog grows thicker over Arles. The  
smoke cruel cut and in my sclera. Cold  
<br>
shatters the panes.
