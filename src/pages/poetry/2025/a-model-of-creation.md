pandora opens her jar and reveals eight  
billion jars inside, cracking to spill onto  
<br>
worlds folded tighter inwards like the  
germinating seeds you claw fervently  
<br>
into the sky with your chipped nails as  
his tremorous hands shift us around.  
<br>
with pretty tricks. three-card montes.  
<br>
does he deal his own hands?  
well, i know the back of mine.  
<br>
borrow a jar from god and  
repeat the shuffle.
